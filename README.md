## Blur all the things! <img src="https://i.imgur.com/zbZR9o9.png" height="32">

The BlurryControls library is meant to give your application a blurry look as it is known from the _AeroGlass_ design.
Please consider that this library runs on Windows 10 only! On Windows 8.1 or older operating systems the application may just appear transparent without any effect. The blurry look is not to be confused with the Acrylic Material appearance of UWP applications.

If you have suggestions or questions, feel free to contact me. :)

It is availlable at NuGet via: `PM> Install-Package BlurryControls`

Have a look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/ConfusedHorse/BlurryControls/wiki) or the provided example projekt called _BlurryControlsInvoker_. For the latter make sure you are using the latest version of Visual Studio for the solution is coded with C#7 and some syntaxes may not be interpreted by the compiler.
