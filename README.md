The BlurryControls library is meant to give your application a blurry look as it is known from the _AeroGlass_ design.
Please consider that this library runs on Windows 10 only! On Windows 8.1 or older operating systems the application may just appear transparent without any effect. The blurry look is not to be confused with the Acrylic Material appearance of UWP applications.

The solution is coded with C#7 so make sure you are using the latest version of Visual Studio.
